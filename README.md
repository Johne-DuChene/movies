<h1>The Kino Project</h1>
<p>This is a simple project I built to practice with SpaCy, which is a library in python for natural language processing.
  Given the presence of terms in a given review, the model I built returns a predicted rating.
  TODO: run more evaluations on model performance.</p>
 <p>Cinema is a big passion of mine, and this project is something I'm currently working on improving.</p>
